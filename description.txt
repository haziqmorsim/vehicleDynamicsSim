Project Description:
This Vehicle Dynamics Simulation models longitudinal and lateral vehicle behavior using MATLAB and Simulink. It simulates responses to traction, drag, rolling resistance, and cornering forces during acceleration, braking, and steering.

Longitudinal dynamics calculate vehicle speed based on a force balance, while lateral dynamics use a bicycle model to estimate yaw rate and sideslip angle under steering input.

Results are plotted over time, and a Simulink model visually represents the system using interactive block diagrams and scopes.

Suitable for automotive engineers, students, and simulation enthusiasts.
